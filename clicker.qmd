:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false
library(mosaic)
data(Births78)
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point() +          
  labs(title = "US Births in 1978")
```
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point() +          
  labs(title = "US Births in 1978")
```
:::

::::

[^14]: c. color must be specified **outside** the `aes()` function

---

15. Why are the dots blue and the lines colored?[^15]
     (a) dot color is given as "navy", line color is given as `wday`.
     (b) both colors are specified in the `ggplot()` function.
     (c) dot coloring takes precedence over line coloring.
     (d) line coloring takes precedence over dot coloring.
     
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
library(mosaic)
data(Births78)
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = wday)) +       
  geom_point(color = "navy") +          
  labs(title = "US Births in 1978")
```
     
[^15]: a. dot color is specified as "navy", line color is specified as `wday`.

---

16. Setting vs. Mapping.  If I want information to be passed to all data points (not variable):[^16]
     (a) map the information inside the `aes()` function.
     (b) set the information outside the `aes()` function
     
[^16]: b. set the information outside the `aes()` function

---

     (b) facilitating comparison
     (c) putting the work in context
     (d) simplifying the story

[^17]: answers may vary. I'd say c. putting the work in context.  Others might say b. facilitating comparison or d. simplifying the story.  However, I don't think a correct answer is a. making the data stand out.

---

18. The Challenger figure(s) was(were) least successful at:[^18]
    (a) making the data stand out
    (b) facilitating comparison
    (c) putting the work in context

     (c) There wasn’t a random sample.
     (d) There wasn’t a label explaining why the axes were where they were.
     
[^20]: a. It isn’t at the origin. in combination with d. There wasn’t a label explaining why the axes were where they were.  The story associated with the average value axes is not clear to the reader.

---

25. What is wrong with the following code?[^25]
    (a) should only  be one =
    (b) Sydney should be lower case
    (c) name should not be in quotes
    (d) use mutate instead of filter
    (e) babynames in wrong place

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
Result <- |> filter(babynames,
		name== “Sydney”)
```

[^25]: e. babynames in wrong place

---

26. Which data represents the ideal format for **ggplot2** and **dplyr**?[^26]

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_a <- tribble(
  ~year, ~Algeria, ~Brazil, ~Columbia,
  2000, 7, 12, 16,
  2001, 9, 14, 18
)
tribble_a |> gt::gt(caption = "table a") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_b <- tribble(
  ~country, ~Y2000, ~Y2001,
  "Algeria", 7, 9,
  "Brazil", 12, 14,
  "Columbia", 16, 18
)
tribble_b |> gt::gt(caption = "table b") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_c <- tribble(
  ~country, ~year, ~value,
  "Algeria", 2000, 7,
  "Algeria", 2001, 9,
  "Brazil", 2000, 12,
  "Brazil", 2001, 14,
  "Columbia", 2000, 16, 
  "Columbia", 2001, 18
)
tribble_c |> gt::gt(caption = "table c") 
```

[^26]: c. Table c is best because the columns allow us to work with each of the variable separately.

---

27. Each of the statements except one will accomplish the same calculation.  Which one does not match?[^27]

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#(a) 
babynames |> 
  group_by(year, sex) |> 
  summarize(totalBirths = sum(num))

#(b) 
group_by(babynames, year, sex) |> 
  summarize(totalBirths = sum(num))

#(c)
group_by(babynames, year, sex) |> 
  summarize(totalBirths = mean(num))

#(d)
temp <- group_by(babynames, year, sex)

summarize(temp, totalBirths = sum(num))

#(e)
summarize(group_by(babynames, year, sex), 
          totalBirths = sum(num))
```

[^27]: c. does something different because it takes the `mean()` (average) instead of the `sum()`.  The other commands compute the total number of births broken down by `year` and `sex`.

  Q1(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(Q2, Q2) |> 
  # for each year for each name
  summarize(total = Q3)
```

#| code-line-numbers: "4,5"
result <- babynames |>
  Q1(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(Q2, Q2) |> 
  summarize(total = Q3)
  # number of babies (each year, each name)
```

[^30]: d. `sum(num)`

---

31. Running the code.[^31]

```{r}
#| echo: true
babynames <- babynames::babynames |> 
  rename(num = n)

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  # just the Janes and Marys
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  # for each year for each name
  summarize(total = sum(num))
```


```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: true

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(number = sum(num))

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(n_distinct(name))

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(n_distinct(num))

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(sum(name))

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(mean(num))

babynames |>
  filter(name %in% c("Jane", "Mary")) |> 
  group_by(name, year) |> 
  summarize(median(num))
```

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)
fig2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig2_path)

ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 2)
```

[^124]: a. Mick

---

    (a) name
    (b) band
    (c) plays
    (d) none of them

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 2)
```

[^125]: d. none of them (all variables are kept in all joins)

library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)

<!--look at exercises: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC-original-website/blob/master/block022_regular-expression.md

which reg expr matches all countries with "ee"

countries with "i" or "t" and ends in "land"; has "ee"; continents with "o"

can use flights data for cities with particular names-->


127. `grep("q[^u]", very.large.word.list)` would not match which of the following?[^127]
    (a) Iraqi
    (b) Iraqian
    (c) Iraq
    (d) zaqqun (tree that "springs out of the bottom of Hell", in the Quran)
    (e) Qantas (the Australian airline)
    
[^127]: neither c. nor e. would match. Inside the bracket "[^u]" matches anything other than a "u", but it has to match something.

---

128. Which of the following regex would match to both "grey" and "gray"?[^128]
    (a) "gr[ae]y"
    (b) "gr(a|e)y"
    (c) "gray | grey"
    (d) "gr[a|e]y"
    (e) some / all of the above -- which ones?

[^128]: e. all of the above. Inside a character class `|` is a normal character and would therefore match "grey" and "gray" and "gr|y".  Which is not what we want, but would work to match both "grey" and "gray".


---

129. What will the result be for the following code?[^129]  
    (a) 10
    (b) 1
    (c) 0
    (d) NA

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("My dog is 10 years old", "\\d")
``` 
    
[^129]: b. 1 (because `\d` matches only a single digit).


---


130. What will the result be for the following code?[^130]  
    (a) 10
    (b) 1
    (c) 0
    (d) NA

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("My dog is 10 years old", "\\d+")
``` 
    
[^130]: a. 10 (because `\d+` matches at least one digit).


---

131. What will the result be for the following code?[^131]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", ".")
```

[^131]: d. E (because `.` matches anything, and returns only a single character).

---

132. What will the result be for the following code?[^132]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", ".+")
```

[^132]: b. Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015) (because `.` matches anything, and with the `+` it returns multiple characters).

---

133. What will the result be for the following code?[^133]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", "\\.")
```

[^133]: a. . (because `\.` matches the period, .).

---

134. How can I pull out just the numerical information in \$47?[^134]
    (a) "(?<=\\$)\\d"
    (b) "(?<=\\$)\\d+"
    (c) "\\d(?=\\$)"
    (d) "\\d+(?=\\$)"

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
str_extract("$47", "(?<=\\$)\\d+")
```

[^134]: b. "(?<=\\$)\\d+"


---

135. You want to know all the types of pies in the text strings.  They are written as, for example "apple pie".[^135]
    (a) "\\w+(?!pie)"
    (b) "\\w+(?! pie)"
    (c) "\\w+(?=pie)"
    (d) "\\w+(?= pie)"

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?= pie)")
```

[^135]: d. "\\w+(?= pie)"

---

```{r}
#| echo: true
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?= pie)")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?=pie)")
```

---

136. We say that lookarounds are "zero-lenghth assertions".  What does that mean?[^136]
    (a) we return the string in the lookaround
    (b) we replace the string in the lookaround
    (c) we return the string at the lookaround
    (d) we replace the string at the lookaround

[^136]: c. we return the string at the lookaround

137. In **SQL**, which operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column?[^137]
    (a) `LIKE`
    (b) `GET`
    (c) `FROM`

[^137]: a. `LIKE` (We didn't cover, and **SQL** has it's own characters, for example `%` for wildcard.)-->

---

137. With **SQL**, how do you select all the records from a table named "Persons" where the value of the column "FirstName" starts with an "a"?[^137]
    (a) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName = 'a.*'
    (b) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName = 'a*'
    (c) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` 'a.*'
    (d) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` 'a*'
    (e) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` '(?i)a.*'

[^137]: e. `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` '(?i)a.*' (n.b., the `LIKE` function will give you a similar result, with `%` as a wildcard: SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName LIKE 'a%')

    (a) name as primary key to both 
    (b) name as foreign to both
    (c) name as primary in enrollment and foreign in grades
    (d) name as foreign in enrollment and primary in grades
    
[^141]: c. name as primary in enrollment and foreign in grades (the primary key must uniquely identify the records, and name is unlikely to do that in a grades database.)

---

[^149]: d. `UPDATE` Persons `SET` LastName='Nilsen' `WHERE` LastName='Hansen' 

---

150. With **SQL**, how can you delete the records where the "FirstName" is "Peter" in the Persons Table?[^150]
    (a) `DELETE` `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName='Peter'
    (b) `DELETE` FirstName='Peter' `FROM` Persons
    (c) `DELETE ROW` FirstName='Peter' `FROM` Persons

[^150]: a. `DELETE` `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName='Peter'

---

151. In the `flights` table, the following `INDEX`es exist: `Tailnum`, `Year`, and `Date`.  How many rows would be looked through if the `WHERE` filter was on `month` only?[^151]
    (a) more than 6.3 million
    (b) less than 6.3 million
    (c) more than 700,000
    (d) less than 700,000
    
[^151]: a. more than 6.3 million. Because there is no index on month (and we don't have a year to incorporate month into the Date index), we need to look through all 48 million rows.

---

152. Which has a larger cardinality, `Tailnum` or `Year`?[^152]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) they have the same cardinality
    (d) neither has a cardinality

[^152]: a. `Tailnum`. The cardinality is the number of unique values, and there are many more unique planes than years.


---

153. Which index takes up more storage space, the one on `Tailnum` or the one on `Year`?[^153]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) they take up the same space
    (d) you can't index on either variable

[^153]: a. `Tailnum`. Because the cardinality is higher, it will take up much more space in the index.

---

154. Which index is more effective at reducing querying time, the one on `Tailnum` or the one on `Year`?[^154]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) the queries would be the same
    (d) you can't query on either variable
    
[^154]: a. `Tailnum`. Because the index is more complete, it will make the querying more efficient.

---

155. What does the **R** function `ifelse(a, b, c)` do?[^155]

    (d) creates a new variable by re-coding an original variable

[^156]: d. creates a new variable by re-coding an original variable

---

157. What does the **R** function `cut()` do?[^157]
    (a) renames a variable
    (b) changes the data type of a variable
    (c) partitions a numeric variable
