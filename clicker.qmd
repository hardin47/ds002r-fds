[^11]: b. In the local folder which also has the R project.  It could be on the Desktop or the Home directory, but it must be in the same place as the R project. Do **not** upload files to the remote GitHub directory or you will find yourself with two different copies of the files.

---

(@) The goal of making a figure is...[^12]
     (a)  To draw attention to your work.
     (b) To facilitate comparisons.
     (c) To provide as much information as possible.

[^12]: Yes! All the responses are reasons to make a figure.

---

(@) A good reason to make a particular choice of a graph is:[^13]
     (a) Because the journal / field has particular expectations for how the data are presented.
     (b) Because some variables naturally fit better on some graphs (e.g., numbers on scatter plots).
     (c) Because that graphic displays the message you want as optimally as possible.

[^13]: c. Because that graphic displays the message you want as optimally as possible.

---

(@) Why are the points orange?[^14]
     (a) R translates "navy" into orange.
     (b) color must be specified in `geom_point()`
     (c) color must be specified **outside** the `aes()` function
     (d) the default plot color is orange

```
:::

::::

[^14]: c. color must be specified **outside** the `aes()` function

---

(@) Why are the dots blue and the lines colored?[^15]
     (a) dot color is given as "navy", line color is given as `wday`.
     (b) both colors are specified in the `ggplot()` function.
     (c) dot coloring takes precedence over line coloring.
     (d) line coloring takes precedence over dot coloring.
     
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 60%
library(mosaic)

  geom_point(color = "navy") +          
  labs(title = "US Births in 1978")
```
     
[^15]: a. dot color is specified as "navy", line color is specified as `wday`.

---

(@) Setting vs. Mapping.  If I want information to be passed to all data points (not variable):[^16]
     (a) map the information inside the `aes()` function.
     (b) set the information outside the `aes()` function
     
[^16]: b. set the information outside the `aes()` function

---

(@) The Snow figure was most successful at:[^17]
     (a) making the data stand out
     (b) facilitating comparison
     (c) putting the work in context
     (d) simplifying the story

[^17]: answers may vary. I'd say c. putting the work in context.  Others might say b. facilitating comparison or d. simplifying the story.  However, I don't think a correct answer is a. making the data stand out.

---

(@) The Challenger figure(s) was(were) least successful at:[^18]
    (a) making the data stand out
    (b) facilitating comparison
    (c) putting the work in context
    (d) simplifying the story

[^18]: a. making the data stand out

---

(@) The biggest difference between Snow and the Challenger was:[^19]
    (a)	The **amount** of information portrayed.
    (b)	One was better at displaying **cause**.
    (c)	One showed the relevant **comparison** better.
    (d)	One was more **artistic**.

[^19]: c. One showed the relevant **comparison** better.

---
 
(@) Caffeine and Calories.  What was the biggest concern over the average value axes?[^20]
     (a) It isn’t at the origin.
     (b) They should have used all the data possible to find averages.
     (c) There wasn’t a random sample.
     (d) There wasn’t a label explaining why the axes were where they were.
     
[^20]: a. It isn’t at the origin. in combination with d. There wasn’t a label explaining why the axes were where they were.  The story associated with the average value axes is not clear to the reader.


---

(@) Why is there no `y` designation in the `aes()` function for the `geom_bar()` geometry?[^20a]
    (a) It is outside the `aes()` function.
    (b) There is a default value for what `y` should be when not specified.
    (c) `y` is specified in `ggplot()`.
    (d) The job of a bar plot is to count the number of instances.
    (e) The `y` variable is the same as the `x` variable.

[^20a]: d. The job of a bar plot is to count the number of instances.

---

(@) What is the difference between `fill = children` and `position = "fill"`?[^20b]
    (a) `fill = children` colors and `position = "fill"` changes the y-axis
    (b) `fill = children` changes the y-axis and `position = "fill"` colors
    (c) `fill = children` goes in the aes and `position = "fill"` goes outside the aes
    (d) `fill = children` goes outside the aes and `position = "fill"` goes inside the aes
    (e) `fill = children` and `position = "fill"` are two different ways to write the same thing.

[^20b]: a. `fill = children` colors and `position = "fill"` changes the y-axis. AND c. `fill = children` goes in the aes and `position = "fill"` goes outside the aes

---

(@) What is the difference between `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`?[20c]
     (a) They are the different names for the same function.
     (b) `geom_bar()` is for numbers and `geom_histogram()` is for categorical variables.
     (c) `geom_bar()` is for categorical variables and `geom_histogram()` is for nubmers.
     (d) `geom_bar()` produces counts and `geom_histogram()` produces percentages.
     (e) `geom_bar()` produces percentages and `geom_histogram()` produces counts.

[^20c]: c. `geom_bar()` is for categorical variables and `geom_histogram()` is for nubmers.

---

(@) Which data represents the ideal format for **ggplot2** and **dplyr**?[^26]

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_a <- tribble(
  ~year, ~Algeria, ~Brazil, ~Columbia,
  2000, 7, 12, 16,
  2001, 9, 14, 18
)
tribble_a |> gt::gt(caption = "table a") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_b <- tribble(
  ~country, ~Y2000, ~Y2001,
  "Algeria", 7, 9,
  "Brazil", 12, 14,
  "Columbia", 16, 18
)
tribble_b |> gt::gt(caption = "table b") 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble_c <- tribble(
  ~country, ~year, ~value,
  "Algeria", 2000, 7,
  "Algeria", 2001, 9,
  "Brazil", 2000, 12,
  "Brazil", 2001, 14,
  "Columbia", 2000, 16, 
  "Columbia", 2001, 18
)
tribble_c |> gt::gt(caption = "table c") 
```

---

[^26]: c. Table c is best because the columns allow us to work with each of the variable separately.


(@) What is wrong with the following code?[^25]
    (a) should only  be one =
    (b) `Bakery` should be upper case
    (c) `type` should not be in quotes
    (d) use mutate instead of filter
    (e) `starbucks` in wrong place

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
Result <- |> filter(starbucks,
		type == "bakery")
```

[^25]: e. `starbucks` in wrong place


---

(@) Each of the statements except one will accomplish the same calculation.  Which one does not match?[^27]

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
#(a) 
starbucks |> 
  group_by(type) |> 
  summarize(average_fat = mean(fat))

#(b) 
group_by(starbucks, type) |> 
  summarize(average_fat = mean(fat))

#(c)
group_by(starbucks, type) |> 
  summarize(average_fat = sum(fat))

#(d)
temp <- group_by(starbucks, type)

summarize(temp, average_fat = mean(fat))

#(e)
summarize(group_by(starbucks, type), 
          average_fat = mean(fat))
```

[^27]: c. does something different because it takes the `sum()` instead of the `mean()`.  The other commands compute the average fat broken down by `type` of Starbucks item

---

    (a) `filter()`

(@) Consider the `addTen()` function.  The following output is a result of which `map_*()` call?[^61]
   a. `map(c(1,4,7), addTen)`
   b. `map_dbl(c(1,4,7), addTen)`
   c. `map_chr(c(1,4,7), addTen)`
   d. `map_lgl(c(1,4,7), addTen)`
   
```{r}
#| echo: true
addTen <- function(wow) {
  return(wow + 10)
}
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
map_chr(c(1,4,7), addTen)
```

[^61]: c. `map_chr(c(1,4,7), addTen)` because the output is in quotes, the values are strings, not numbers.

---

(@) Which of the following input is allowed?[^62]
    a. `map(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)`
    b. `map(list(1, 4, 7), addTen)`
    c. `map(data.frame(a=1, b=4, c=7), addTen)`
    d. some of the above
    e. all of the above

[^62]: e. all of the above.  The `map()` function allows vectors, lists, and data frames as input.

---

(@) Which of the following produces a different output?[^63]
    a. `map(c(1, 4, 7), addTen)`
    b. `map(c(1, 4, 7), ~addTen(.x))`
    c. `map(c(1, 4, 7), ~addTen)`
    d. `map(c(1, 4, 7), function(hi) (hi + 10))`
    e. `map(c(1, 4, 7), ~(.x + 10))`
    
[^63]: c. `map(c(1, 4, 7), ~addTen)`.  The `~` acts on functions that do not have their own name or that are defined by `function(...)`.  By adding the argument `(.x)` we've expanded the `addTen()` function, and so it needs a `~`.  The `addTen()` function all alone does not use a `~`.
