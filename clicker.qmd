#| echo: false
#| out-width: 50%

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)
fig2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig2_path)

ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 2)
```

[^25]: d. none of them (all variables are kept in all joins)
 

---

    (a) Mick is removed
    (b) guitar
    (c) bass
    (d) NA
    (e) `NULL`

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 40%

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "images/members.jpg"
fig2_path <- "images/instruments.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)
fig2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig2_path)

ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 2)

---

<!--look at exercises: https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC-original-website/blob/master/block022_regular-expression.md

which reg expr matches all countries with "ee"

countries with "i" or "t" and ends in "land"; has "ee"; continents with "o"

can use flights data for cities with particular names-->


27. `grep("q[^u]", very.large.word.list)` would not match which of the following?[^27]
    (a) Iraqi
    (b) Iraqian
    (c) Iraq
    (d) zaqqun (tree that "springs out of the bottom of Hell", in the Quran)
    (e) Qantas (the Australian airline)
    
[^27]: neither c. nor e. would match. Inside the bracket "[^u]" matches anything other than a "u", but it has to match something.

---

28. Which of the following regex would match to both "grey" and "gray"?[^28]
    (a) "gr[ae]y"
    (b) "gr(a|e)y"
    (c) "gray | grey"
    (d) "gr[a|e]y"
    (e) some / all of the above -- which ones?

[^28]: e. all of the above. Inside a character class `|` is a normal character and would therefore match "grey" and "gray" and "gr|y".  Which is not what we want, but would work to match both "grey" and "gray".


---

29. What will the result be for the following code?[^29]  
    (a) 10
    (b) 1
    (c) 0
    (d) NA

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("My dog is 10 years old", "\\d")
``` 
    
[^29]: b. 1 (because `\d` matches only a single digit).


---


30. What will the result be for the following code?[^30]  
    (a) 10
    (b) 1
    (c) 0
    (d) NA

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("My dog is 10 years old", "\\d+")
``` 
    
[^30]: a. 10 (because `\d+` matches at least one digit).


---

31. What will the result be for the following code?[^31]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", ".")
```

[^31]: d. E (because `.` matches anything, and returns only a single character).

---

32. What will the result be for the following code?[^32]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", ".+")
```

[^32]: b. Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015) (because `.` matches anything, and with the `+` it returns multiple characters).

---

33. What will the result be for the following code?[^33]
    (a) .
    (b) Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)
    (c) Episode
    (d) E

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
str_extract("Episode 2: The pie whisperer. (4 August 2015)", "\\.")
```

[^33]: a. . (because `\.` matches the period, .).

---

34. How can I pull out just the numerical information in \$47?[^34]
    (a) "(?<=\\$)\\d"
    (b) "(?<=\\$)\\d+"
    (c) "\\d(?=\\$)"
    (d) "\\d+(?=\\$)"

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
str_extract("$47", "(?<=\\$)\\d+")
```

[^34]: b. "(?<=\\$)\\d+"


---

35. You want to know all the types of pies in the text strings.  They are written as, for example "apple pie".[^35]
    (a) "\\w+(?!pie)"
    (b) "\\w+(?! pie)"
    (c) "\\w+(?=pie)"
    (d) "\\w+(?= pie)"

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?= pie)")
```

[^35]: d. "\\w+(?= pie)"

---

```{r}
#| echo: true
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?= pie)")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
str_extract(c("apple pie", "chocolate pie", "peach pie"), "\\w+(?=pie)")
```

---

36. We say that lookarounds are "zero-lenghth assertions".  What does that mean?[^36]
    (a) we return the string in the lookaround
    (b) we replace the string in the lookaround
    (c) we return the string at the lookaround
    (d) we replace the string at the lookaround

[^36]: c. we return the string at the lookaround


<!--
---

37. In **SQL**, which operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column?[^57]
    (a) `LIKE`
    (b) `GET`
    (c) `FROM`

[^37]: a. `LIKE` (We didn't cover, and **SQL** has it's own characters, for example `%` for wildcard.)-->

---

37. With **SQL**, how do you select all the records from a table named "Persons" where the value of the column "FirstName" starts with an "a"?[^37]
    (a) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName = 'a.*'
    (b) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName = 'a*'

    (d) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` 'a*'
    (e) `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` '(?i)a.*'

[^37]: e. `SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName `REGEXP` '(?i)a.*' (n.b., the `LIKE` function will give you a similar result, with `%` as a wildcard: SELECT` * `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName LIKE 'a%')

---

38. What is the main way to absolutely recognize a record within a database?[^38]
    (a) Foreign key
    (b) Primary key

    (b) Directly identifies another column
    (c) Gives access to another entire database
    (d) Translates the database into another language
    
[^39]: b. Directly identifies another column

---

40. Which of these would likely be used as a foreign key between a table on student enrollment and student grades?[^40]
    (a) grades
    (b) tuition
    (c) student\_name
    (d) student\_hometown
    
[^40]: c. student\_name

---

41. For the student records (for two tables: enrollment and grades), which is the most likely combination?[^41]
    (a) name as primary key to both 
    (b) name as foreign to both
    (c) name as primary in enrollment and foreign in grades
    (d) name as foreign in enrollment and primary in grades
    
[^41]: c. name as primary in enrollment and foreign in grades (the primary key must uniquely identify the records, and name is unlikely to do that in a grades database.)

    (a) `DELETE` `FROM` Persons `WHERE` FirstName='Peter'
    (b) `DELETE` FirstName='Peter' `FROM` Persons
    (c) `DELETE ROW` FirstName='Peter' `FROM` Persons

---

51. In the `flights` table, the following `INDEX`es exist: `Tailnum`, `Year`, and `Date`.  How many rows would be looked through if the `WHERE` filter was on `month` only?[^51]
    (a) more than 6.3 million
    (b) less than 6.3 million
    (c) more than 700,000
    (d) less than 700,000
    
[^51]: a. more than 6.3 million. Because there is no index on month (and we don't have a year to incorporate month into the Date index), we need to look through all 48 million rows.

---

52. Which has a larger cardinality, `Tailnum` or `Year`?[^52]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) they have the same cardinality

---

53. Which index takes up more storage space, the one on `Tailnum` or the one on `Year`?[^53]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) they take up the same space
    (d) you can't index on either variable

[^53]: a. `Tailnum`. Because the cardinality is higher, it will take up much more space in the index.

---

54. Which index is more effective at reducing querying time, the one on `Tailnum` or the one on `Year`?[^54]
    (a) `Tailnum`
    (b) `Year`
    (c) the queries would be the same
    (d) you can't query on either variable
    
[^54]: a. `Tailnum`. Because the index is more complete, it will make the querying more efficient.

---

55. What does the **R** function `ifelse(a, b, c)` do?[^55]
    (a) a = TRUE option, b = FALSE option, c = question
    (b) a = FALSE option, b = TRUE option, c = question
    (c) a = question, b = TRUE option, c = FALSE option
    (d) a = question, b = FALSE option, c = TRUE option

[^55]: c. a = question, b = TRUE option, c = FALSE option

---

56. What does the **R** function `case_when()` do?[^56]
    (a) renames a variable
    (b) changes the data type of a variable
    (c) partitions a numeric variable
    (d) creates a new variable by re-coding an original variable

[^56]: d. creates a new variable by re-coding an original variable

---

57. What does the **R** function `cut()` do?[^57]
    (a) renames a variable
    (b) changes the data type of a variable
    (c) partitions a numeric variable
    (d) creates a new variable by re-coding an original variable

[^57]: c. partitions a numeric variable
