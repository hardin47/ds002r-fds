<!--

You will conduct a small simulation study which does one of these tasks:

a) investigates the effects of a factor or two on the power of a statistical test

b) investigates the effects of condition violations on a statistical test, as measured by coverage rate, confidence interval width, type I error rate, etc.

c) conducts a randomization-type test by simulating behavior under the null hypothesis

d) develops a lineup protocol for visual inference, as in Adam Loy: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26939169.2021.1920866#d1e209

Your simulation study should contain the following elements:

- at least 1 function you've written
- at least 1 loop (it can be imperative or functional, or you can try it both ways)
- at least 1 illustrative, well-labeled plot
- a description of what insights can be gained from your plot(s)

### Timeline


Mini-Project 3 must be submitted on Canvas (not Gradescope) by **11:59 PM on Wednesday October 30**.  Ideally, you will add a tab to your Quarto webpage for Mini-Project 3, then you can just submit the new page's URL. Alternatively, you may submit a Rendered pdf showing all code and output.
