# Agenda  11/17/24 + 11/19/24

1. Joining
2. Other combinations

# Today's example

## IMDb

Consider a database of information from <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/" target = "_blank">IMDb</a>.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("../images/ted-lasso.jpg")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

con_imdb <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),
  dbname = "imdb",
  host = Sys.getenv("SMITH_HOST"),
  user = Sys.getenv("SMITH_USER"),
  password = Sys.getenv("SMITH_PWD")
)
```



## IMDb {.scrollable}

21 tables in the `imdb` database!  Lots of details on movies, TV series, video games, and more. Today interest is in movies (and details within, like actors and ratings).

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SHOW TABLES;
```

## IMDb - glance through tables {.scrollable}

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM kind_type
LIMIT 0, 10;
```


## All the `JOIN`s


* `JOIN` (aka `INNER JOIN`): include all of the rows that exist in both tables
* `LEFT JOIN`: include all of the rows in the first table.  
* `RIGHT JOIN`: include all of the rows in the second table. 
* `FULL OUTER JOIN`: include all rows in either table. (The functionality doesn't exist in **MySQL** but can be created using joins and `UNION`.)
* `CROSS JOIN`: match each row of the first table with each row in the second table. 


## All the `JOIN`s

## All the `JOIN`s

Mini data tables of the different types of `JOIN`.  (In **SQL** the missing values will be labeled as `NULL` (not `NA`).)

```

## All the `JOIN`s

Each `JOIN` clause needs four specific pieces of information:

1. The name of the first table you want to `JOIN`.
2. The type of `JOIN` being used.
3. The name of the second table you want to `JOIN`.
4. The condition(s) under which you want the records in the first table to match records in the second table.

## A toy example {.scrollable}

Rock bands from the 60s.

```{r}
band_members
band_instruments
```

The function `sqldf()` in the **sqldf** **R** package allows for **SQL** commands on **R** objects.

## Rock bands - `INNER JOIN` {.scrollable}

An inner join combines two datasets returning only the observations that exist in both of the original datasets.

```{r}
sqldf::sqldf("SELECT star.name,
                     star.band,
                     inst.plays
              FROM band_members AS star
              JOIN band_instruments AS inst ON star.name = inst.name")
```


## Rock bands - `FULL JOIN` {.scrollable}

A full join combines two datasets returning every observation that exists in either one of the original datasets.  

```{r}
band_members |>
  full_join(band_instruments)
```

The `full_join()` function does not have an equivalent in **MySQL**.  See notes for using `JOIN`s and `UNION`s to produce a full join.

## Rock bands - `LEFT JOIN` {.scrollable}

A left join combines two datasets returning every observation that exists in the left (or first) original dataset.  

```{r}
sqldf::sqldf("SELECT star.name,
                     star.band,
                      inst.plays
              FROM band_members AS star
              LEFT JOIN band_instruments AS inst 
              ON star.name = inst.name")
```


## Rock bands - `RIGHT JOIN` {.scrollable}

A right join combines two datasets returning every observation that exists in the right (or second) original dataset. 

```{r}
sqldf::sqldf("SELECT inst.name,
                     star.band,
                      inst.plays
              FROM band_members AS star
              RIGHT JOIN band_instruments AS inst 
              ON star.name = inst.name")
```


## Rock bands - `CROSS JOIN` {.scrollable}

A right join combines two datasets returning every observation that exists in the right (or second) original dataset. 

```{r}
sqldf::sqldf("SELECT *
              FROM band_members AS star
              CROSS JOIN band_instruments AS inst")
```


## `JOIN` IMDb title + votes {.scrollable}

In the `imdb` database, the `title` table includes information about the 4,626,322  titles in the database, including the `id`, `title`, `kind_id` (indicator for the kind of ID it is), and `production_year`.  It does not, however, include the review of the title. 

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM title LIMIT 0, 10;
```

## `JOIN` IMDb title + votes {.scrollable}

The `movie_info_idx` table does not contain much information about each particular film.  It does, however, have an indicator for the movie ID (given by `movie_id`) as well as the number of votes (given by `info` where `type_id = 100`). 

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM movie_info_idx LIMIT 0, 6;
```
## `JOIN` IMDb title + votes {.scrollable}

* combine the titles with the number of votes so that each title with user votes is included (`INNER JOIN`)


```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT title.id,
       title.title,
       movie_info_idx.info
FROM title
JOIN movie_info_idx ON title.id = movie_info_idx.movie_id 
WHERE title.production_year = 2015 
    AND title.kind_id = 1                  # movies only
    AND movie_info_idx.info_type_id = 100  # info_type is votes
    AND movie_info_idx.info > 150000       # at least 150,000 votes
ORDER BY movie_info_idx.info DESC
LIMIT 0, 20;

```

Some aspects of the query are worth pointing out:  
* The variables in the output are given in the `SELECT` clause.  The `id` and `title` (both from the `title` table) and the `info` from the `movie_info_idx` which represents the number of IMDb votes.
* The variables are preceded by the table from which they came. While not always necessary, it is good practice so as to avoid confusion.
* The `JOIN` happens by linking the `id` variable in the `title` table with the `movie_id` variable in the `movie_info_idx` table.
* The `LIMIT` wasn't necessary (there are only 12 observations), but it's good practice so that we don't end up with unwieldy query results.
* The `WHERE` clause happens before the `JOIN` action, despite being written after.
* In the `WHERE` clause, we keep only movies, only 2015 production year, and only at least 150,000 votes.

## `JOIN` IMDb title + actress {.scrollable}

`cast_info` contains the `person_id` and the `movie_id`

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM cast_info LIMIT 0, 10;

```


`person_role_id` is `1` if actor and `2` if actress


## `JOIN` IMDb title + actress {.scrollable}

`aka_name` contains `person_id` and `name` (of actor)

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM aka_name LIMIT 0, 10;

```


## `JOIN` IMDb title + actress {.scrollable}

`title` contains `id` and `title` (of the movie)

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM title LIMIT 0, 10;

```

## `JOIN` IMDb title + actress {.scrollable}

Goal: identify the actresses in those movies with the highest number of votes.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT t.title,
       idx.info,
       a.person_id,
       n.name
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON t.id = idx.movie_id 
JOIN cast_info AS a ON idx.movie_id = a.movie_id
JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015 
    AND t.kind_id = 1           # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100  # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 150000       # at least 150,000 votes
    AND a.role_id = 2           # actresses only
ORDER BY a.person_id
LIMIT 0, 50;
```

Connecting the most popular movies of 2015 with the actresses in those movies requires a series of `JOIN`s. Note that to make the code less onerous, the `title` table has been aliased by `t`, the `movie_info_idx` table has been aliased by `idx`, the `cast_info` table has been aliased by `a`, and the `aka_name` table has been aliased by `n`.

There is a lot of data cleaning to do as some of the `person_id` values are one to many!!  That is, the `person_id` matches multiple names in the `aka_name` database.


## Other `JOIN`s

Let's look at `RIGHT JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` using two new smaller tables.

1. The first has seven movies in it (from 2015 with at least 400,000 IMDb votes).  

2. The second consists of almost 3 million actresses (`person_role_id = 2`).  In order to find a subset of actresses, the `person_id > 3900000` was set arbitrarily (in order to have a smaller group with which to work).

Using subqueries, we can `JOIN` the two datasets using different `JOIN` techniques.


## movies:  {.scrollable}

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT t.id,
       t.title,
       idx.info,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM title AS t
       JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
       WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
             AND t.kind_id = 1
             AND idx.info_type_id = 100
             AND idx.info > 400000) AS row_count
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1             # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100    # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000         # at least 400,000 votes
ORDER BY idx.info DESC;
```


## actresses: {.scrollable}

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb


SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM cast_info AS a
       JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
       WHERE a.person_role_id = 2  
             AND a.person_id > 390000) AS row_count
FROM cast_info AS a
JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
       WHERE a.person_role_id = 2  
             AND a.person_id > 3900000
LIMIT 0, 20;
```



## Inner `JOIN` {.scrollable}

With an inner `JOIN`, there are 32 rows corresponding to all the actresses in the seven 2015 films with the most votes.  Because the `JOIN` is an intersection of the two tables, only the actresses with `person_id` above 3900000 are included.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM
(SELECT t.id,
       t.title
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000) AS movs  # at least 400,000 votes     
INNER JOIN (SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name
    FROM cast_info AS a
    JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
    WHERE a.role_id = 2             # acresses only
        AND a.person_id > 3900000) AS acts ON acts.movie_id = movs.id
LIMIT 0, 300;

```


## `RIGHT JOIN` {.scrollable}

With a `RIGHT JOIN`, there are more than 300 rows (the `LIMIT` clause keeps us from knowing how many rows, but there are a LOT!) corresponding to all the actresses whose `person_id` above 3900000 are included.  Those actresses who acted in one of the seven top 2015 films are also included in the full results table, but they don't happen to be in the truncated output here. 


```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM
(SELECT t.id,
       t.title
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000) AS movs  # at least 400,000 votes     
RIGHT JOIN (SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name
    FROM cast_info AS a
    JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
    WHERE a.role_id = 2             # acresses only
        AND a.person_id > 3900000) AS acts ON acts.movie_id = movs.id
LIMIT 0, 300;

```

## `LEFT JOIN` {.scrollable}

With a `LEFT JOIN`, there are 33 rows corresponding to the actresses in the seven top 2015 movies. Only **The Revenant** did not have any actresses whose `person_id` is greater than 3900000.


```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT * FROM
(SELECT t.id,
       t.title
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000) AS movs  # at least 400,000 votes     
LEFT JOIN (SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name
    FROM cast_info AS a
    JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
    WHERE a.role_id = 2             # acresses only
        AND a.person_id > 3900000) AS acts ON acts.movie_id = movs.id
LIMIT 0, 300;

```



## Counting repeat actresses {.scrollable}

We might, for example, want to know how many names / spellings of a name with a specific `person_id` (above 3900000) exist for each `person_id` in each of the top voted seven films of 2015.  

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT acts.person_id, 
       COUNT(*) AS num_repeat_names
FROM (SELECT t.id,
       t.title
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000) AS movs  # at least 400,000 votes
JOIN (SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name
    FROM cast_info AS a
    JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
    WHERE a.role_id = 2             # acresses only
        AND a.person_id > 3900000) AS acts ON acts.movie_id = movs.id
GROUP BY acts.person_id;
```


## Counting number of actresses per film {.scrollable}

We might, for example, want to know how many actresses with a specific `person_id` (above 3900000) are in each of the top voted seven films of 2015.  

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT movs.id, 
       movs.title,
       COUNT(*) AS num_actress
FROM (SELECT t.id,
       t.title
FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               # movies only
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      # info_type is votes
    AND idx.info > 400000) AS movs  # at least 400,000 votes
JOIN (SELECT a.person_id,
       a.movie_id,
       n.name
    FROM cast_info AS a
    JOIN aka_name AS n ON a.person_id = n.person_id
    WHERE a.role_id = 2             # acresses only
        AND a.person_id > 3900000) AS acts ON acts.movie_id = movs.id
GROUP BY movs.id;
```

## `UNION`ing

In **SQL** a `UNION` clause combines two different tables by their rows (whereas `JOIN` combines two tables by columns). Think about `UNION` similarly to the `bind_rows()` command in **R**.

```{r}
#| out.width: 120%
#| fig-cap: "UNION binds rows while JOIN appends columns, image credit: Jane Williams https://blog.devart.com/mysql-union-tutorial-html.html"
#| fig-alt: Mini data tables describing how UNION binds rows and JOIN appends columns.
#| echo: false

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)

fig1_path <- "../images/join-union.png"
fig2_path <- "../images/union-all.png"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)
fig2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig2_path)

ggarrange(fig1, fig2, ncol = 1)
```

## `UNION`s

Silly example where the column names are ignored.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

SELECT 
    1 AS bar,
    2 AS foo

UNION

SELECT 
    10 AS foo,
    20 AS bar;
```



## `UNION` {.scrollable}

`UNION` is specifically designed to bind rows from two different `SELECT` queries where the variables have been selected in the same order.

Combine the top voted movies from 2015 with the top voted movies from 2019.  

However, to account for time, we require the movies from 2015 to have more votes (400,000) than the movies from 2017 (200,000).  

That is, the `WHERE` clause is different for the two subqueries.


## `UNION` {.scrollable}
```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

(SELECT t.title, 
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 400000)

UNION

(SELECT t.title, 
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2017  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 200000)
LIMIT 0, 100;
```



## `UNION ALL` {.scrollable}

If the goal is to include duplicates across two tables, use `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`.

Let's say that the first table is all movies with production year after 2012 and number of votes greater than 500,000.  The second table is movies with production year equal to 2015 and number of votes greater than 400,000.  

The Martian would be in both tables.

## `UNION ALL` {.scrollable}

With just `UNION`

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

(SELECT t.title,
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year > 2012  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 500000)

UNION

(SELECT t.title, 
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 400000)
ORDER BY production_year DESC, num_votes;

```

## `UNION ALL` {.scrollable}

When `UNION ALL` is applied, The Martian is listed twice in the results table.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_imdb

(SELECT t.title,
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year > 2012  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 500000)

UNION ALL

(SELECT t.title, 
        t.production_year, 
        idx.info AS num_votes
    FROM title AS t
JOIN movie_info_idx AS idx ON idx.movie_id = t.id
WHERE t.production_year = 2015  
    AND t.kind_id = 1               
    AND idx.info_type_id = 100      
    AND idx.info > 400000)
ORDER BY production_year DESC, num_votes;

```


## Best practice

It is always a good idea to terminate the **SQL** connection when you are done with it.

```{r}
DBI::dbDisconnect(con_imdb, shutdown = TRUE)
```
