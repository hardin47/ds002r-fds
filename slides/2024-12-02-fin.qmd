## Take-aways

* 80-90% of data science work is data wrangling and visualization
* wrangling the data well is usually more important than modeling the data well
* there are many choices along the way, there is no such thing as **truth**
* if you can't reproduce the work, you should question whether to trust it
* communicating to your audience is likely the most important aspect of doing data science
