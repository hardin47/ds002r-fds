# What is Shiny?


> Shiny is an R package that allows you to easily create rich, interactive web apps. Shiny allows you to take your work in R or Python and expose it via a web browser so that anyone can use it. 

## Examples

See the following gallery of Shiny example from Posit: <a href = "https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/" target = "_blank">https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/</a>

## A simple Shiny App

Put the following into a Shiny App using `File` $\rightarrow$ `New File` $\rightarrow$ `Shiny Web App ...` as a file called `app.R`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  "Hello, world!"
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("../images/shiny_start.png")
```

## What are the parts of a Shiny App?

Looking closely at the code above, the `app.R` does four things:

1. It calls `library(shiny)` to load the shiny package.

2. It defines the user interface, the HTML webpage that humans interact with. In this case, it’s a page containing the words "Hello, world!".

3. It specifies the behaviour of our app by defining a server function. It’s currently empty, so our app doesn’t do anything, but we’ll be back to revisit this shortly.

4. It executes `shinyApp(ui, server)` to construct and start a Shiny application from UI and server.

## How to run a Shiny App?

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## To run Shiny

* Click the Run App button in the document toolbar.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("../images/shiny_run.png")
```

* Use a keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter.

* If you're not using RStudio, you can (`source()`) the whole document, or call `shiny::runApp()` with the path to the directory containing `app.R`.

## What does it look like?


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("../images/shiny_running.png")
```

## Back in R...

Go back and look at the console.  You will see something like:

```
Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7521
```

R is busy!  It is running your Shiny App.  You can't do anything in R because the processes are engaged with the Shiny App.


# Deconstructing Shiny

## Pieces

Shiny applications will be contained in one `app.R` file. The file contains two key components:

`ui`: code for the user interface. The user interface is the webpage that your user will interact with. 

`server`: code for the computer part. What should the computer/server do with your inputs as the user changes them. 

The last code at the bottom, `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`, will compile everything together to result in the interactive webpage.

Press Run App at the top of RStudio and see what happens!

## Pieces

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(shiny)

shinyApp(
  ui = list(
    # new (to you) widgets go here
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    # somewhat familiar (to you) code goes here
  }
)
```

## The default Shinny App

```{r}
#| eval: false
#
# This is a Shiny web application. You can run the application by clicking
# the 'Run App' button above.
#

#

library(shiny)

# Define UI for application that draws a histogram
ui <- fluidPage(

    # Application title
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),

    # Sidebar with a slider input for number of bins 
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)
        ),

        # Show a plot of the generated distribution
        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("distPlot")
        )
    )
)

# Define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {

    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white',
             xlab = 'Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)',
             main = 'Histogram of waiting times')
    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

## Running Old Faithful

* Run in RStudio

* See the app in action here: <a href = "https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/faithful/" target = "_blank">https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/start-simple/faithful/</a>

## reactive()

The function `reactive()` is worth pointing out.  It is used to create a reactive expression — an expression that is automatically recalculated when any of its inputs change.

Use `reactive()` when

* You want to perform calculations that depend on user input and automatically update when those inputs change.
* You need to pass dynamically calculated values to other parts of the app (outputs, observers, etc.).
* You need to create reactive data or state, such as subsets or transformations of input data.

Do not use `reactive()` within any of the `render*()` functions because they are inherently reactive already!

## Live demo

Let's build a weather app!  See sample files here:  <a href = "https://github.com/hardin47/ds002r-fds/tree/main/Shiny_weather" target = "_blank">https://github.com/hardin47/ds002r-fds/tree/main/Shiny_weather</a>
