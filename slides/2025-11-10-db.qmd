# Agenda  11/10/25

1. Databases
2. SQL connections
3. SQL in Quarto (3 ways)


# **SQL**:\n Structured Query Language

## What is a database?

* structured collection of data organized with
    - efficient storage
    - easy retrieval
    - consistent management
    
* data stored in tables which are linked to one another via keys (called a relational database, think `join`)

* SQL is a database management system (DBMS)


## Tidy data

* data frame (R) or table (SQL)
* columns of variables
* rows of observational units

## **SQL** dialects

You may have heard of some of the following **SQL** dialects

* **MySQL**
* **DuckDB**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **BigQuery**
* **SQLite**

They are very similar, and you will be able to quickly pick up whichever dialect your institution uses. In our work, we will use **MySQL**.

## Differences between **R** and **SQL**

* tables in **SQL** databases can be arbitrarily large
    - live in storage, computer's hard drive (usually remote)
    
* data frames in **R** 
    - live in memory (RAM) on your personal computer
    
    
* tables in a database are linked via a key


# Today's example

## The `airlines` database

Consider a database of US flights between 2013 and 2015.  The flights are downloaded from the <a href = "https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Homepage.asp" target = "_blank">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>, US Department of Transportation. The database is a superset of the `nycflights13` **R** package that tracks only flights in and out of airports serving New York City in 2013.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("../images/airport-terminal.jpg")
```




## **SQL** connection

To set up a **SQL** connection, you need the location of the server (`host`) as well as a `user`name and `password`.

```{r}
con_air <- DBI::dbConnect(
  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),
  dbname = "airlines",
  host = "mdsr.crcbo51tmesf.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
  user = Sys.getenv("MDSR_USER"),
  password = Sys.getenv("MDSR_PWD")
)
```

Hadley Wickham discusses how to use Sys.getenv: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/secrets.html


## Tables in `airlines` database


```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(con_air)
```




## **SQL** tables as `tbl`

```{r}
carriers <- dplyr::tbl(con_air, "carriers")
dim(carriers)
head(carriers)
```



## **SQL** tables as `tibble`

The function `collect()` copies a **SQL** table from its server location on disk to your local memory location in **R**.

```{r}
carriers_tibble <- carriers |>
  dplyr::collect()

dim(carriers_tibble)
head(carriers_tibble)
```




## How much space does `carriers` take up?

The data frame in **R** takes up 2 orders of magnitude of memory more than the table which just points to the object in **SQL**.

```{r}
carriers |>
  object.size() |>
  print(units = "Kb")

carriers_tibble |>
  object.size() |>
  print(units = "Kb")
```



## What is **SQL**?

* **SQL** is a programming language for working with relational databases.
* **SQL** has been around since the 1970s, but has, unfortunately, many different dialects.
* To connect to the **mdsr** database (via **R**), use **MySQL**.



# Using **SQL** in Quarto

We will write **SQL** code in three distinct ways:

1. Using the package **dbplyr** **R** will directly translate **dplyr** code into **SQL**.
2. Using the **DBI** package, we can send **SQL** queries through an `r` chunk.
3. Using a `sql` chunk, we can write actual **SQL** code inside a Quarto document.



## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

The function `dbListTables()` in the **DBI** package will tell us what tables exist in the **airlines** database.

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(con_air)
flights <- dplyr::tbl(con_air, "flights")
carriers <- dplyr::tbl(con_air, "carriers")
```


## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

* Over what years is the `flights` data taken?

```{r}
yrs <- flights |>
  summarize(min_year = min(year), max_year = max(year))

yrs
```

## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

Because `flights` is not actually a `data.frame` in **R** (but instead a `tbl` in **SQL**), the work that was done above was actually performed in **SQL**.  To see the **SQL** code, we can use the function `show_query`.

```{r}
dplyr::show_query(yrs)
```


## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**


* Create a data set containing only flights between `LAX` and `BOS` in 2015.

```{r}
la_bos <- flights |>
  filter(year == 2015 & ((origin == "LAX" & dest == "BOS") | 
           (origin == "BOS" & dest == "LAX"))) 

dplyr::show_query(la_bos)
```

## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

```{r}
flights_head <- flights |> 
  head(8)

dplyr::show_query(flights_head)
```

## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

```{r}
flights_number<- flights |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  summarize(num_flights = n()) |> 
  arrange(num_flights)

dplyr::show_query(flights_number)
```

## 1. Translating **dplyr** code into **SQL**

* **dbplyr** doesn't translate every **R** command into **SQL**.

* **SQL** is not a statistical software and doesn't, for example, have a mechanism for creating data visualizations.

* track which **R** commands are connected to **SQL** at the <a href = "https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/" target= "_blank">**dbplyr** reference sheet</a>.

## 2. **SQL** queries via the **DBI** package

* Look at the first few rows of the `flights` data.

```{r}
DBI::dbGetQuery(con_air,
                "SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 8;")
```


## 2. **SQL** queries via the **DBI** package

* How many flights per year are in the `flights` table?

```{r}
DBI::dbGetQuery(con_air, 
  "SELECT year, count(*) AS num_flights 
  FROM flights 
  GROUP BY year 
  ORDER BY num_flights;")
```

## 3. Direct **SQL** queries via `sql` chunks {.scrollable}

**SQL** queries can be written directly inside a `sql` chunk in Quarto.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_air
#| echo: fenced

SELECT * FROM flights LIMIT 8;
```


## 3. Direct **SQL** queries via `sql` chunks {.scrollable}

**SQL** queries can be written directly inside a `sql` chunk in Quarto.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_air
#| echo: fenced

SELECT year, count(*) AS num_flights 
       FROM flights 
       GROUP BY year 
       ORDER BY num_flights;
```

## Good practice

Always a good idea to terminate the **SQL** connection when you are done with it.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(con_air, shutdown = TRUE)
```


# Using **SQL** in **DBeaver**

(we won't use **DBeaver** but info is here, FYI)

* **DBeaver** is a free **SQL** client that supports **MySQL**.

* A "client" means that the software is just for **SQL** (and not for running models or making visualizations, like **R**).

* writing **SQL** code in **R** has some benefits (e.g., piping results tables into **ggplot2** for visualizations).

* using a **SQL** client that is designed for **SQL** queries has benefits as well.  

* to use **DBeaver**, <a href = "https://dbeaver.io/download/" target = "_blank">download the client</a> onto your computer and open it from your Applications.
