# Working on assignments with GitHub and Gradescope


In DS002R, we will use GitHub + Gradescope to access and submit assignments.  Here is the basic structure of how it will work:

1. Get the assignment materials from GitHub.
2. Clone the repository to any machine you are using.
3. Work on the assignment and push back to GitHub.
4. Submit the assignment on Gradescope.

```

The following diagram lays out the process, and the rest of the document provides a more detailed set of instructions.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Flowchart of assignment process.", fig.alt = "Flowchart demonstrating that assignments are recieved from Git, processed on your computer (iteratively with GitHub), and submitted to Gradescope."}

```

# Installing R + RStudio + Git

Most importantly, please become familiar with <a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a>.  Happy Git with R is an incredibly user friendly resource which includes help for almost every single thing that might happen when getting started.  

<aside>
<a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a> is your new best friend.
</aside>

1. The first step is to install R + RStudio + Git on your machine.  (If you are planning to use Pomona's RStudio server, R + RStudio + Git are all three already installed for you.)

2. Create an account on GitHub (if you already have one, use it!).

3. Introduce everyone:  R + RStudio (should happen automatically); yourself to GitHub (see <a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a>); RStudio + GitHub (see <a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a>).

4. Follow the rest of the steps that Jenny Bryan spells out in <a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a>.  Most likely, you only need to work through step 12.  Step 15 is detailed below after you have gotten the assignment from GitHub.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The more you read Happy Git with R, the better your life will be.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of the Happy Git with R webpage."}
include_graphics("images/happygitwithr.png")
```

# Get the assignment materials from GitHub


Each assignment will be provided within a separate GitHub repository. You will get to the specific repository via the <a href = "https://github.com/orgs/ST47S-FODS-Fall2024/repositories" target = "_blank">course organization</a>. 


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The course organization which lists all of the assignment repositories.  Click on the repository associated with the specific week's HW assignment.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of GitHub showing what the course organization will look like for a given student."}
include_graphics("images/hw-repos.png")
```

The assignment files will be copied as a private repository that you (and your partner(s), if applicable) and the course TAs have access to.  Notice that all of the repos are tagged "private."

We will call this version, that lives on your personal GitHub account, the *GitHub fork*.


# Clone the assignment (or project) repository on to your own computer(s)

Once your repository has been created, you should clone the code to whatever computer you are working on.  Just like a Google Doc, you can work on the files from different machines at different times.  Unlike a Google Doc, you'll have to make sure to open the repo (`clone` or `pull` if you've already `clone`d) and save the repo (`commit` + `push`) more deliberately.

<aside>
<a href = "https://happygitwithr.com/" target = "_blank">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a> is your new best friend.
</aside>

1. From the course organization, lick on the link for the correct repository.

2. Click the green `Code` button and copy the URL.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Copy the HTTPS URL, and use it to create a new project in RStudio.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of GitHub showing the location of the repo URL."}
include_graphics("images/repo-clone.png")
```

3. On the cloning machine (e.g., your own compute or the RStudio server), create a new R project with the URL copied from above.  Follow the steps at https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html (section 15.2 New RStudio Project via git clone).


# Work on the assignment, push back to GitHub

<aside>
&#9888; Always start your work session with a pull to the computer you are working on, and end your session with a push back to GitHub.
</aside>

All of the GitHub interaction will take place through the RStudio IDE.  The two important steps for getting the assignment back to GitHub are:

## `pull`

If you are working with a colleague or on different machines it is so incredibly important to get in the habit of immediately clicking on `pull` when you start your work.  (If you are working alone on a single machine `pull` won't hurt!  You'll just be told that your files are already up to date.)


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Always pull before you start. pull-work-save-commit-push", fig.alt = "Screen shot of how to pull using the Rstudio IDE."}
include_graphics("images/pull.png")
```

## `Render` your work

Don't forget to put your name on the assignment.  Also, make sure that you Render to pdf.  Render early and often.  The more often you Render, the fewer headaches you will have.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Always pull before you start. pull-work-render-commit-push", fig.alt = "Screen shot of how to Render using the RStudio IDE."}
include_graphics("images/name-render.png")
```

## `commit` your work

You don't need to commit every file, but you do need to commit files that are integral to the analysis (always commit .qmd, .pdf, data files, images that created the pdf, etc.).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="pull-work-render-commit-push", fig.alt = "Screen shot of how to commit using the RStudio IDE."}
include_graphics("images/choose-commit.png")
```

## `push` your work to GitHub

It is good practice to use meaningful commit messages to help your future self figure out your past work.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="pull-work-render-commit-push", fig.alt = "Screen shot of how to push using the RStudio IDE."}
include_graphics("images/commit-push.png")
```

## check your work on GitHub

To make sure that the work went through, always check your GitHub repo online to confirm any changes you made.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Check that your changes are correct.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of checking GitHub changes online."}
include_graphics("images/check-github.png")
```


# Submit the assignment on Gradescope

You will submit your assignments via Gradescope on Canvas.

<span style="color:red">ITS and I are still working through a few kinks getting GitHub and Gradescope to talk to one another on Canvas.  The instructions below are old from Sakai.  They will be updated once the Canvas process is in place.</span>

To submit your assignment, complete the following steps:

<aside>
The first time you submit, you may need to click "Connect to GitHub", to connect your Gradescope account to your GitHub account.
</aside>

1. Access the courseâ€™s Gradescope site, select the appropriate assignment, and then choose GitHub as the submission method.  You must access the course's Gradescope site via the side menu in Canvas.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Access Gradescope via Canvas.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of Gradescope connection from inside Canvas."}
include_graphics("images/gradescope-sakai.png")
``` 

2. The first time you submit your repository, you will need to authorize Gradescope to access your git repository. Select the appropriate repository and branch (branch will almost always be `main`).

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Submit files directly from GitHub.", fig.alt = "Screen shot of Gradescope instruction to submit via GitHub."}
include_graphics("images/gradescope-github.png")
``` 

3. If this is a pair-programming submission, you will need to associate all team members with the submission. After you upload your files, click "Add Group Member" and add your partner to the submission. Add your team member to your Gradescope submission



You can submit multiple times before the deadline. Your last submission will be assessed.

Once assignments are assessed, you will be able to see feedback on GitHub. You can `pull` assignment feedback back onto your own computer.
