## The course 

**Foundations of Data Science in R** is a first course in data science. Data play an increasingly important role in many fields. Being able to understand data and the ethical implications in data driven decisions is paramount to being an informed member of society. As an introduction to data science with R, this course will introduce students to basic data science concepts. Prerequisite: CSCI004 or CSCI005 or CSCI051 or equivalent experience in programming.

## Anonymous Feedback

As someone who is, myself, constantly learning and growing in many ways, I welcome your feedback about the course, the classroom dynamics, or anything else you'd like me to know.  There is a link on Canvas to an anonymous feedback form.  Please feel free to provide me with feedback at any time!

## Student Learning Outcomes.
By the end of the term, students will be able to:

* scrape, process, and clean data from the web
* wrangle data in a variety of formats
* contextualize variation in data
* construct point and interval estimates using resampling techniques
* design accurate, clear and appropriate data graphics
* query large relational databases (using SQL)
* work fluently with regular expression
* communicate data-driven decisions


## Inclusion Goals^[adapted from Monica Linden, Brown University]

In an ideal world, science would be objective. However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will make an effort to recognize how science (and data science!) has played a role in both understanding diversity as well as in promoting systems of power and privilege. I acknowledge that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature. Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science. I would like to discuss issues of diversity in statistics as part of the course from time to time.

Please contact me if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me.  You can also relay information to me via your mentors.  I want to be a resource for you. 

I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.  As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.

#### Using R (through the RStudio IDE)

R will be used for many assignments.
You can use R on the Smith server: <a href = "https://rstudio.smith.edu/" target = "_blank">https://rstudio.smith.edu/</a>.

Alternatively, feel free to download both R and RStudio onto your own computer.
R is freely available at <a href = "http://www.r-project.org/" target = "_blank">http://www.r-project.org/</a>; RStudio is also free and allows you to turn in all R assignments using Quarto <a href = "http://rstudio.org/" target = "_blank">http://rstudio.org/</a>.

#### GitHub

Assignments will be turned in using GitHub.  See <a href = "https://sds261-sql.netlify.app/syllabus" target = "_blank">instructions for using GitHub</a> on the course website.

## Important Features

#### Prerequisites:

The prerequisite for this class is SDS 192, Introduction to Data Science.

#### Labs:

Labs will take place on most days with the lab write-up due just before the following class period. See <a href = "https://sds261-sql.netlify.app/syllabus" target = "_blank">instructions for using GitHub</a> on the course website for how to turn in assignments.

#### Grading:

The class expectations are that you show up for class and labs and turn in a final project. A successful final project is required to pass the class.  Additionally, you should not miss more than 1 or 2 classes nor should you miss turning in more than 1 or 2 labs.
