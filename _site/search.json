You will also compile the projects, reflect on the process, and present your work to your classrmates. Project information is available here: DS 002R Projects\n\n\n\n\nGitHub will be used as a way to practice reproducible and collaborative science. There may be a slight learning curve, but knowing Git will be an extremely useful skill as you venture beyond this class.\nR will be used for all homework assignments. R is freely available at http://www.r-project.org/ and is already installed on college computers. Additionally, you need to install R Studio in order to use Quarto, https://posit.co/downloads/. If you are not already familiar with R, please work through some of the materials provided ASAP.\nYou are welcome to use Pomona’s R Studio server at https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu/ (or https://rstudio.pomona.edu if you are off campus). If you use the server, you can connect directly to your Git account without installing Git locally on your own computer. [If you are not a Pomona student, you will need to get an account from Pomona’s ITS. Go to ITS, tell them that you are taking a Pomona course, and ask for an account for using RStudio.]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis class will be interactive, and your engagement is expected (every day in class). Although notes will be posted, your engagement is an integral part of the in-class learning process.\nIn class: after answering one question, wait until 5 other people have spoken before answering another question. [Feel free to ask as many questions as often as you like!]\n\n\n\n\nYou are on your honor to present only your work as part of your course assessments. Below, I’ve provided Pomona’s academic honesty policy. But before the policy, I’ve given some thoughts on cheating which I have taken from Nick Ball’s CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof Ball!). Prof Ball gives us all something to think about when we are learning in a classroom as well as on our journey to become scientists and professionals:\nThere are many known reasons why we may feel the need to “cheat” on problem sets or exams:\n\n\nAn academic environment that values grades above learning.\nFinancial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue pressure on maintaining a high GPA.\nNavigating school, work, and/or family obligations that have diverted focus from class.\nChallenges balancing coursework and mental health.\nBalancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.\n\n\nBeing accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be devastating for students. The college requires me to respond to potential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and damaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer alternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process. If you find yourself in a situation where “cheating” seems like the only option:\nPlease come talk to me. We will figure this out together.\nPomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are expected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in their exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the community. The college expects students to understand and adhere to basic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nIn projects and assignments prepared independently, students never represent the ideas or the language of others as their own.\nStudents do not destroy or alter either the work of other students or the educational resources and materials of the College.\nStudents neither give nor receive assistance in examinations.\nStudents do not take unfair advantage of fellow students by representing work completed for one course as original work for another or by deliberately disregarding course rules and regulations.\nIn laboratory or research projects involving the collection of data, students accurately report data observed and do not alter these data for any reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease email and / or set up a time to talk if you have any questions about or difficulty with the material, the computing, or the course. Talk to me as soon as possible if you find yourself struggling. The material will build on itself, so it will be much easier to catch up if the concepts get clarified earlier rather than later. This semester is going to be fun. Let’s do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\n30% Homework\n30% Quizzes\n30% Projects & Final Presentation\n10% Class engagement\n\n\n\n\n:::"

However, I encourage you to consider the overall project as a potential deliverable that you could include on a resume, show to future employers, discuss in graduate school interviews, etc. That is, approach the assignment as an opportunity for you to take something away from the class which is bigger than just a grade.\n\n:::\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Some possible topics to investigate include:\n\nInvestigation of the proportional hazards assumption (what does the R function cox.zph() do?)\nExponential or Weibull PH regression (parametric survival model)\nDeriving / detailing AIC & BIC for model selection on Cox PH\nPower analysis (a simulation?)\nDerivation of the sample size calculation for the log rank test (and application to the data)\nAn analysis of the Schoenfeld residuals (how are they calculated and why is that calculation relevant?)\nBootstrapping the survival model (what are the assumptions? what do you conclude?)\nAn analysis of possible time dependent covariates (what should you see? what do you see? do transformations help?)\nAn analysis / understanding / simulation of the multiple comparisons issues for assessing many different models (or other exploratory hypotheses).\nAndersen-Gill extension of the Cox PH model for time-varying covariates (available in rms R package).

You may, however, transform (mutate()) the variables within your R code (that is, for example, if you wanted to divide months by 12 to have years, or square a variable, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nYour primary assessment will be based on the above items (modeling, understanding of new topic, additional analysis, interpretation).\nAdditionally there will be two competitions.

    "text": "Big picture\nYour project is meant to answer a question using data. The vast majority of the work will be on the data wrangling side, but you might hope to have a plot or two at the end to help tie together your ideas.\n\nTopics\nThe topics above are meant to direct the project productively. They are not meant to limit you. If you have an idea for a project that doesn’t quite fit into what is outlined above (but is related to the course content), let’s talk about it! Most likely, your idea will fit into the project goals.\nExpanding on the topics above to get you started…\n\n1. SQL queries\nThroughout the course, we’ve seen a few different databases. There are more available in the R mdsr package, and you also have access to some additional MySQL server databases through Smith. Additionally, the professor has access to a MySQL server that contains all of the Stanford Open Policing data, and you are welcome to work with it (just ask for login information). So many interesting questions to consider!\n\n\n2. Regular expressions\nYou might think about web scraping to retrieve data (probably using the rvest R package). For example, you might scrape details about every Taylor Swift song and use regular expressions to format the information in a way that allows easy question asking.\nOr you might find a dataset on the Gilmore Girls and scrape IMDb to match the ratings for each episode.\n\n\n3. Creating SQL database\nYou can use any of a variety of platforms to create a SQL database. As in the class notes and labs, you can create a database using DuckDB. Alternatively, you can use Smith’s MySQL server. Or, you can use SQLite to create a database (in a similar way to DuckDB).\nFor example, you might create a database using the Saturday Night Live data and update all of the files with more recent episodes.\nOr you might look for a TidyTuesday dataset to upload. For example, consider data on cats in the UK which references similar datasets in the US, Australia, and New Zealand.\nIf you are creating a new SQL database, make sure that your database has three or more tables that link to one another."

See the README file.\n\n\nPull in the flights table as a tbl (do not use collect()!). Use dplyr commands to calculate the number of flights that flew into or out of BDL in 2012. Then use dplyr::show_query() to output the SQL query. (All done inside an R chunk.)\n\n\nAgain, inside an R chunk, use DBI::dbGetQuery() to run the SQL code calculated in the previous question.\n\n\nNow, inside a SQL chunk, use the SQL commands directly (same task: how many flights in and out of BDL in 2012).\n\n\nRerun all three scenarios, using the tictoc R package to see which method calculates the desired number most quickly. Below is an example of how to use tictoc. For the SQL chunk, you’ll need to place tic() in an R chunk before the SQL chunk and toc() in an R chunk after the SQL chunk. Write 1-2 sentences describing the results.\n\n\nlibrary(tictoc)\n\ntic()\nrand_numbers &lt;- rnorm(1000000)\nquantile(rand_numbers)\n\n           0%           25%           50%           75%          100% \n-4.7441954424 -0.6750814407  0.0006767307  0.6734974364  5.6445201338 \n\ntoc()\n\n0.097 sec elapsed\n\n\n\nUsing R on the tbl.\n\n\nUsing dbGetQuery().\n\n\nUsing SQL chunk.\n\n\nNow create a tibble (not a tbl) that includes only flights in 2012 either to or from BDL (use collect()). After you have created the tibble, summarize the observations to get the count. Use tictoc to evaluate how long the process takes. Write 1-2 sentences describing the results.\n\n\nDBeaver: open DBeaver from your applications. Following the instructions in the DBeaver online notes, set up a connection to the mdsr SQL server. Create a file called lab1-sds261-yourlastname-yourfirstname.sql and SAVE THE FILE in the lab1 R Project folder. Run the same SQL code as above. Did you get the same result? Were there any adjustments to the SQL code from above? Explain in a few sentences.\n\n\nReflect on at least 3 things that you learned during this lab. It could be about technical aspects. It could be about understanding databases. It could be about the difference between R and SQL. Anything you learned while doing the lab.\n\n\nAlways a good idea to terminate the SQL connection when you are done with it.\n\n\ndbDisconnect(con_air, shutdown = TRUE)\n\n\nrender - commit - push to GitHub. You should push three files, those with extensions .qmd, .html, and .sql. In a browser, look at your GitHub website to make sure that all three files were successfully pushed to the correct repo (yours for lab1)."

Below is an example of how to use tictoc. For the SQL chunk, you’ll need to place tic() in an R chunk before the SQL chunk and toc() in an R chunk after the SQL chunk.

After you have created the tibble, summarize the observations to get the count. Use tictoc to evaluate how long the process takes.

Following the instructions in the DBeaver online notes, set up a connection to the mdsr SQL server. Create a file called lab1-sds261-yourlastname-yourfirstname.sql and SAVE THE FILE in the lab1 R Project folder. Run the same SQL code as above. Did you get the same result? Were there any adjustments to the SQL code from above? Explain in a few sentences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, there were still 41,949 flights to and from BDL in 2012. Whew! It would have been very odd if there had been a different number because the database itself hasn’t changed at all, we are just sending the query using a different client.\nI needed to remove the back ticks from the table and variable names. R uses backticks but DBeaver does not. Good to remember.\nI had set up my connection to the entire mdsr database, so I needed to add the line USE airlines; to the top of my SQL query so that it would be able to find the flights table. I could have also specified where flights lives using: ... FROM airlines.flights....\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on at least 3 things that you learned during this lab. It could be about technical aspects. It could be about understanding databases. It could be about the difference between R and SQL. Anything you learned while doing the lab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthere are different ways to run the same SQL commands\nsome approaches are more efficient than other approaches\nthe RStudio IDE is flexible in that it allows both R and SQL code\nDBeaver is a more typical SQL client in that many lines of SQL code can be written simultaneously, and the SQL connection says in tact for the entire set of queries.\nthe airlines database has a ginormous about of information which exists in four tables: airports, carriers, flights, and planes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways a good idea to terminate the SQL connection when you are done with it.\n\n\ndbDisconnect(con_air, shutdown = TRUE)\n\n\nrender - commit - push to GitHub. You should push three files, those with extensions .qmd, .html, and .sql. In a browser, look at your GitHub website to make sure that all three files were successfully pushed to the correct repo (yours for lab1)."

While not always necessary, it is good practice so as to avoid confusion. * The JOIN happens by linking the id variable in the title table with the movie_id variable in the movie_info_idx table. * The LIMIT wasn’t necessary (there are only 12 observations), but it’s good practice so that we don’t end up with unwieldy query results. * The WHERE clause happens before the JOIN action, despite being written after. * In the WHERE clause, we keep only movies, only 2015 production year, and only at least 150,000 votes."

In order to find a subset of actresses, the person_id &gt; 3900000 was set arbitrarily (in order to have a smaller group with which to work).\n\nUsing subqueries, we can JOIN the two datasets using different JOIN techniques."

For instance if \\(x\\) is NULL, then \\(x &gt; 3\\), \\(1 = x\\), and \\(x + 4\\) all evaluate to NULL. Even \\(x =\\) NULL evaluates to NULL! if you want to check whether \\(x\\) is NULL, use x IS NULL or x IS NOT NULL.\nNULL short-circuits with boolean operators. That means a boolean expression involving NULL will evaluate to:\n\nTRUE, if it’d evaluate to TRUE regardless of whether the NULL value is really TRUE or FALSE.\nFALSE, if it’d evaluate to FALSE regardless of whether the NULL value is really TRUE or FALSE.\nOr NULL, if it depends on the NULL value.\n\n\ntaken from: https://cs186berkeley.net/notes/note1/#filtering-null-values"

Unfortunately, FOREIGN KEYs don’t work here because there is not referential integrity across the tables.\n\n\nUse COPY to load the data from your computer. (Hint: if there is an NA value, SQL doesn’t know that it is actually NULL and wants the variable to be loaded as a character string.)\n\n\nUse SELECT * (with a LIMIT!) to make sure all three tables loaded correctly.\n\n\nAdd an INDEX to the tuition table on state.

For example, you can add or delete columns, create or destroy indexes, change the type of existing columns, or rename columns or the table itself.\nMultiple ADD, ALTER, DROP, and CHANGE clauses are permitted in a single ALTER TABLE statement, separated by commas.\nCaveat: I have found DuckDB to be slightly finicky in some of the operations…\n\n\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1\nDROP COLUMN col1,\nDROP COLUMN col2;\n\n\n\n\n\nrename an INT NOT NULL column from a to b and change its definition to use the BIGINT data type while retaining the NOT NULL attribute.\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE a b BIGINT NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\nCHANGE, the syntax requires two column names, so you must specify the same name twice to leave the name unchanged. For example, to change the definition of column b.\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b b INT NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\nMODIFY is more convenient to change the definition without changing the name because it requires the column name only once.\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1 MODIFY b INT NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\nCHANGE, the syntax requires a column definition, so to leave the definition unchanged, you must respecify the definition the column currently has. For example, to rename an INT NOT NULL column from b to a.\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE b a INT NOT NULL;\n\n\n\n\n\nRENAME COLUMN is more convenient to change the name without changing the definition because it requires only the old and new names.\n\n\nALTER TABLE t1 RENAME COLUMN b TO a;\n\n\n\n\n\ncannot RENAME COLUMN to a column name that already exists. The following are valid.\n\n\n/* swap a and b */\nALTER TABLE t1 RENAME COLUMN a TO b,\n               RENAME COLUMN b TO a;\n\n/* \"rotate\" a, b, c through a cycle */\nALTER TABLE t1 RENAME COLUMN a TO b,\n               RENAME COLUMN b TO c,\n               RENAME COLUMN c TO a;\n\n\n\n\nTemporary tables are used to break down complex queries into smaller, more manageable steps. For example, let’s say we want to JOIN two tables after each has been filtered using different WHERE clauses. The filtered tables can each be saved into their own temporary tables and then the temporary tables can be merged.\nTables in DuckDB are saved (to disk), even when the connection is closed. However, temporary tables are saved in memory (instead of on disk) and are deleted when the connection is closed.\n\n\n\n\nSELECT * FROM episodes LIMIT 10;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nsid\nepid\naired\nepno\n\n\n\n\n46\n20210410\nApril 10, 2021\n17\n\n\n46\n20210403\nApril 3, 2021\n16\n\n\n46\n20210327\nMarch 27, 2021\n15\n\n\n46\n20210227\nFebruary 27, 2021\n14\n\n\n46\n20210220\nFebruary 20, 2021\n13\n\n\n46\n20210213\nFebruary 13, 2021\n12\n\n\n46\n20210206\nFebruary 6, 2021\n11\n\n\n46\n20210130\nJanuary 30, 2021\n10\n\n\n46\n20201219\nDecember 19, 2020\n9\n\n\n46\n20201212\nDecember 12, 2020\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe wouldn’t want to wrangle the date every single time we used the data.\n\nCREATE TEMP TABLE episodes_date AS\n    SELECT *, CASE\n             WHEN POSITION(',' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN\n    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CAST(\n                SUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2) || '-' ||\n                CASE\n                    WHEN POSITION('January' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '01'\n                    WHEN POSITION('February' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '02'\n                    WHEN POSITION('March' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '03'\n                    WHEN POSITION('April' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '04'\n                    WHEN POSITION('May' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '05'\n                    WHEN POSITION('June' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '06'\n                    WHEN POSITION('July' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '07'\n                    WHEN POSITION('August' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '08'\n                    WHEN POSITION('September' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '09'\n                    WHEN POSITION('October' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '10'\n                    WHEN POSITION('November' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '11'\n                    WHEN POSITION('December' IN aired) &gt; 0 THEN '12'\n                    ELSE '01' -- Default to January if no month is found\n                END || '-' ||\n                SUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(' ' IN aired) + 1, 2) AS DATE\n            ))\n            END AS year FROM episodes;\n\n\n\n\nIn case you are curious about the date wrangling code… consider SUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2)\n\nPOSITION(',' IN aired): This part of the expression uses the POSITION function to find the position of the first occurrence of the comma (,) in the string aired. The result is the index (position) of the comma within the string.\nPOSITION(',' IN aired) + 2: This adds 2 to the index of the comma. The + 2 is used to move the starting point of the substring two positions to the right of the comma. This is done to exclude the comma itself and any following spaces.\nSUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2): This part uses the SUBSTRING function to extract a substring from the string aired. The starting position of the substring is determined by POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2, and it goes until the end of the string. This effectively removes the part of the string that comes before and including the first comma.\n\nIn summary, the entire expression is extracting a substring from the original string aired, starting from two positions to the right of the first comma and continuing until the end of the string. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to remove or isolate part of a string based on the position of a specific character (in this case, the comma).\n\n\n\n\nSELECT * FROM episodes_date LIMIT 10;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\nsid\nepid\naired\nepno\nyear\n\n\n\n\n46\n20210410\nApril 10, 2021\n17\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210403\nApril 3, 2021\n16\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210327\nMarch 27, 2021\n15\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210227\nFebruary 27, 2021\n14\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210220\nFebruary 20, 2021\n13\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210213\nFebruary 13, 2021\n12\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210206\nFebruary 6, 2021\n11\n2021\n\n\n46\n20210130\nJanuary 30, 2021\n10\n2021\n\n\n46\n20201219\nDecember 19, 2020\n9\n2020\n\n\n46\n20201212\nDecember 12, 2020\n8\n2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that the year variable has been created in the new temporary table called episodes_date, we can use episode_date to query and find, for example, all of the hosts in 2019.\n\nSELECT hosts.aid, ep.aired, ep.year FROM hosts \nJOIN episodes_date AS ep ON hosts.epid = ep.epid\nWHERE year = 2019\nLIMIT 25;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\naid\naired\nyear\n\n\n\n\nEddie Murphy\nDecember 21, 2019\n2019\n\n\nScarlett Johansson\nDecember 14, 2019\n2019\n\n\nJennifer Lopez\nDecember 7, 2019\n2019\n\n\nWill Ferrell\nNovember 23, 2019\n2019\n\n\nHarry Styles\nNovember 16, 2019\n2019\n\n\nKristen Stewart\nNovember 2, 2019\n2019\n\n\nChance the Rapper\nOctober 26, 2019\n2019\n\n\nDavid Harbour\nOctober 12, 2019\n2019\n\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge\nOctober 5, 2019\n2019\n\n\nWoody Harrelson\nSeptember 28, 2019\n2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is always a good idea to terminate the SQL connection when you are done with it.\n\ndbDisconnect(con_duckdb, shutdown = TRUE)\n\n\n:::"

The duckdb_read_csv() function in the duckdb R package allows us to load the .csv file (available on GitHub) directly into the database without being loaded as an R object first.\nRecall that in ?@tbl-select-describe we used DESCRIBE to display the variable types of the database table(s). The list includes the variable name (Field), its Type, whether there are NULL values allowed, and whether there are keys or indices defined on the variable. See Table 2 for the DESCRIBE output on the table we are about to import.\nUnlike R, when creating a new data table, SQL requires that you communicate each future variable (column) and that variable’s type.

By indexing the rows, SQL is able to optimize sorting and joining tables. The index is created in advance (when the table is created) and saved to disk, which can take up substantial space on the disk. Sometimes more than one variable is used to index the table. There are trade-offs to having a lot of indices (disk space but fast wrangling) versus a few indices (slow wrangling but less space)."

Each page (row) has a unique page number to identify it (key value); to find a particular page, you sort through the page numbers (key values). But it isn’t immediately obvious where the particular page of interest is, you might have to page through the book a little bit to find the page of interest. It would be easier if you had several bookmarks throughout the book to anchor some of the page numbers. For example, if you want page 1047 and you have a bookmark on page 1050, you only have to turn back three pages. The bookmark is an index, it helps you find the desired rows much more quickly.1\n\nAnalogy taken from: https://www.quora.com/profile/Lara-Mazilu"

    "text": "Index\nIndices are the crux of why SQL is so much more efficient than, say, R. An index is a lookup table that helps SQL keep track of which records contain certain values. By indexing the rows, SQL is able to optimize sorting and joining tables. The index is created in advance (when the table is created) and saved to disk, which can take up substantial space on the disk. Sometimes more than one variable is used to index the table. There are trade-offs to having a lot of indices (disk space but fast wrangling) versus a few indices (slow wrangling but less space)."

If, for example, the SNL queries were always done by year, then the episodes table could be partitioned such that they are stored as separate tables (one per year). The partitioning functions as an index on year. The user would not be able to tell the difference between the unpartitioned episodes table and the partitioned one. However, queries done by year would be faster. Queries done grouped in another way would be slower."

    "text": "In case you are curious about the date wrangling code… consider SUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2)\n\nPOSITION(',' IN aired): This part of the expression uses the POSITION function to find the position of the first occurrence of the comma (,) in the string aired. The result is the index (position) of the comma within the string.\nPOSITION(',' IN aired) + 2: This adds 2 to the index of the comma. The + 2 is used to move the starting point of the substring two positions to the right of the comma. This is done to exclude the comma itself and any following spaces.\nSUBSTRING(aired, POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2): This part uses the SUBSTRING function to extract a substring from the string aired. The starting position of the substring is determined by POSITION(',' IN aired) + 2, and it goes until the end of the string. This effectively removes the part of the string that comes before and including the first comma.\n\nIn summary, the entire expression is extracting a substring from the original string aired, starting from two positions to the right of the first comma and continuing until the end of the string. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to remove or isolate part of a string based on the position of a specific character (in this case, the comma)."

    "text": "Overview\nPart of being a successful data scientist is communicating your work and demonstrating that you know how to communicate your work. To that end, you will each be creating your own website with some of the course projects (see caveat below!).\nYou will produce a personal website using Quarto that contains, at a minimum, a Home/About page with a picture or image (doesn’t have to be of you, could be some kind of art, etc., but make sure you have permission to post whatever you include), some basic information about you, and a link to the GitHub repo that contains the R code for your website.\nThen, in the Menu bar, you should have a selection called “Data Viz” with two sub-selections, each being a TidyTuesday analysis.\n\n\nWebsite\nTo make the website follow the instructions at Creating your personal website using Quarto by Sam Csik.\n\n\nTidyTuesday\nFor each analysis, find a TidyTuesday dataset and create a plot (start with a qmd file and create an html file). Your YAML might look something like this (note that the format here is html, unlike the pdf that we use for the homework).\n---\ntitle: \"Super Mario Kart\"\ndescription: |\n  Analysis of Super Mario Kart data from TidyTuesday\nauthor: Jo Hardin\ndate: September 18, 2024\nformat: html\n---\nThe TidyTuesday analysis can be quite minimal. One scatterplot per analysis is fine, and you don’t need to annotate or make it beautiful (of course, you might want to make it beautiful…). It is your choice whether or not to show the code. (Do you think it is better to show the code or hide the code? No right answer.) Please include the source of the data (which might be the TidyTuesday page + the original source of the information).\nInside your _quarto.yml file (see https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/#modify-website-appearance-in-_quarto.yml), you might have something like the following:\nwebsite:\n  title: \"My phenomenal first website!\"\n  navbar:\n    right: \n      - text: \"About Me\"\n        href: about.html\n      - text: \"Data Viz\"\n        menu: \n         - text: \"Mario Kart\"\n           href: mariokart.html\n         - text: \"Campus Pride Index\"\n           href: pride.html\n\n\nCaveat to personal website / FERPA\nThe assignment as written asks you to submit a public facing website. Generally, students like the idea of making such a website because future employers will be impressed by your work. However, I am sensitive to the fact that you may have reasons to not want to have a public facing website. If this is you (for any reason, you don’t need to explain yourself), there are two alternative options for the mini-project assignment:\n\nWhile creating the website, make-up everything (including a new GitHub repository, created using a different email address) and don’t include anything personal or anything that would link to you.\nComplete the assignment using a private repository. None of the information will be publicly available (that is, your URL won’t be accessible to the public). You must, however, give me access to the repository (invite me as a collaborator), and then I can pull your repo, render it locally, and give you credit for the assignment by compiling the entire website locally on my computer.\n\n\n\nTimeline\nMini-Project 1 must be submitted on Canvas (not Gradescope) by 11:59 PM on Wednesday September 18. All you need to submit is a URL for your website (or private GitHub repo if you take that route)!\n\n:::\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

But before the policy, I’ve given some thoughts on cheating which I have taken from Nick Ball’s CHEM 147 Collective (thank you, Prof Ball!). Prof Ball gives us all something to think about when we are learning in a classroom as well as on our journey to become scientists and professionals:\nThere are many known reasons why we may feel the need to “cheat” on problem sets or exams:\n\n\nAn academic environment that values grades above learning.\nFinancial aid is critical for remaining in school that places undue pressure on maintaining a high GPA.\nNavigating school, work, and/or family obligations that have diverted focus from class.\nChallenges balancing coursework and mental health.\nBalancing academic, family, peer, or personal issues.\n\n\nBeing accused of cheating – whether it has occurred or not – can be devastating for students. The college requires me to respond to potential academic dishonesty with a process that is very long and damaging. As your instructor, I care about you and want to offer alternatives to prevent us from having to go through this process. If you find yourself in a situation where “cheating” seems like the only option:\nPlease come talk to me. We will figure this out together.\nPomona College is an academic community, all of whose members are expected to abide by ethical standards both in their conduct and in their exercise of responsibilities toward other members of the community. The college expects students to understand and adhere to basic standards of honesty and academic integrity. These standards include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n\nIn projects and assignments prepared independently, students never represent the ideas or the language of others as their own.\nStudents do not destroy or alter either the work of other students or the educational resources and materials of the College.\nStudents neither give nor receive assistance in examinations.\nStudents do not take unfair advantage of fellow students by representing work completed for one course as original work for another or by deliberately disregarding course rules and regulations.\nIn laboratory or research projects involving the collection of data, students accurately report data observed and do not alter these data for any reason."

More often than not, the associated code is there. There are also ggplot galleries of images, one of them is here: https://plot.ly/ggplot2/\nLook at the end of this presentation and the syllabus. More help options there."
