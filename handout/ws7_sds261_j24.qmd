Your Name: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   


Names of people you worked with:  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   

* Do you remember everyone's name? On which social media platform/website/TV series do you waste too much of your time?

* What are your plans for the summer?  Have you started working toward figuring them out?

\medskip

Consider the following fictional tables which exist in a fictional hospital database.^[Example taken from http://cs.iit.edu/~cs425/previous/14fall/]

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center

library(cowplot)
library(ggpubr)
library(patchwork)

fig1_path <- "../images/donor.jpg"
fig2_path <- "../images/doctor.jpg"
fig3_path <- "../images/organ.jpg"
fig4_path <- "../images/patient.jpg"
fig5_path <- "../images/takecare.jpg"

fig1 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig1_path)
fig2 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig2_path)
fig3 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig3_path)
fig4 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig4_path)
fig5 <- ggdraw() + draw_image(fig5_path)

(fig1 + fig2 + fig3) / (fig4 + fig5)
```


* Variables with black background are the primary keys of a table.
* The variable `donor` of table `organ` is a foreign key to table `donor`.
* The variable `patient` of table `takeCare` is a foreign key to table `patient`.
* The variable `doctor` of table `takeCare` stores doctors. However, it is not a foreign key to table doctor, because the primary key of that table also includes insurance information.

**Task:**

Write **SQL** code to accomplish the following tasks (one **SQL** operation for each of the four tasks).

1. Delete all organs that were available before 2014.

2. Increase the rate of all doctors for HMO insurances by 1,000.

3. Insert a new `organ` 'Liver' for `donor` 'Alice' available in '2016'.

4. Update the availability of all hearts to 2016 if their current availability is 2015.


\newpage
**Solution:**

1. Delete all organs that were available before 2014.

```{sql}
#| eval: false

DELETE FROM organ
    WHERE available < 2014;
```

2. Increase the rate of all doctors for HMO insurances by 1,000.

```{sql}
#| eval: false

UPDATE doctor
    SET rate = rate + 1000
    WHERE insurance = 'HMO'
```


3. Insert a new `organ` 'Liver' for `donor` 'Alice' available in '2016'.

```{sql}
#| eval: false

INSERT INTO organ VALUES ( 'Alice', 'Liver' , 2014);

```

4. Update the availability of all hearts to 2016 if their current availability is 2015.

```{sql}
#| eval: false

UPDATE organ
    SET available = 2016
    WHERE organ = 'Heartâ€™ AND available = 2015;
```
