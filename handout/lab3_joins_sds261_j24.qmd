Today's lab will provide practice working with **SQL** clauses in **DBeaver**.  Don't forget the importance of the <a href = "https://st47s.com/SDS261/Notes/03-sql-verbs.html" target = "_blank">order of the **SQL** clauses</a>. 

The goals for lab 3 include:

* additional working with clauses in **SQL**.
* understanding each of `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT`.
* practicing running **SQL** queries in a **SQL** client, **DBeaver**.
* `JOIN`ing tables


## Advice for turning in the assignment

* Be sure to indicate (in the .sql file) which problem is being answered with which **SQL** code.  Use the following syntax to comment within a .sql file: `/* here is where comments go */`.  Indeed, feel free to *copy the question* into the .sql file so that you have it for your own records.

* save the .Rproj file somewhere you can find it.  Don't keep everything in your downloads folder.  Maybe make a folder called `SDS261` or something.  That folder could live on your Desktop.  Or maybe in your Dropbox.  

* The **SQL** document should be saved in the **R** Project as `lab3-sds261-yourlastname-yourfirstname.sql`.  You will have to navigate to the **R** Project to save the **DBeaver** file in the correct place.

* Connect to the `yelp` database, which contains the `businesses`, `reviews`, and `users` tables.  See README file for connection details.


```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp

SHOW TABLES;
```

##  Assignment


1. For each of the three tables in the `yelp` database, identify the number of records and the variables.  (That means, write at least a sentence for each table.)

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT * FROM businesses LIMIT 0, 5;
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT * FROM reviews LIMIT 0, 5;
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 0, 5;
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM businesses;
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews;
```

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

```{block}
#| unilur-solution: true

businesses: 11,537 records with variables of id, name, stars, open, review_count, city, longitude, latitude

reviews: 229,907 records with variables of business_id, user_id, stars

users: 43,873 records with variables of user_id, name, average_stars, review_count

```

2. Find the user with the most reviews.  What is the person's name, and how many reviews did they make?

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT user_id, name, average_stars, review_count
FROM users
ORDER BY review_count DESC
LIMIT 0, 5;
```


```{block}
#| unilur-solution: true

Kim has the most reviews (5,807 reviews!) with an average rating of 3.77 stars.
```

3. What cities are represented in the businesses table?  Find out by querying the number of businesses per city.  Use `LIMIT` to start, just in case there are hundreds of cities.  Write down a few of the city names.  Do you notice anything interesting?

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(*), city
FROM businesses
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city
LIMIT 0, 100;
```


```{block}
#| unilur-solution: true

There appear to be cities in Phoenix as well as in Pheonix (??).  And a few of the city names include the AZ to indicate that they are in Arizona.  Before really working with the data, we would want to clean up the city names.
```


4. Find the businesses in "Carefree" (a city in Arizona).  Write down the names of a few of the businesses.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT id, name, stars, open, review_count, city
FROM businesses
WHERE city = "Carefree"
LIMIT 0, 50;
```

5. Count the number of records resulting when the query connects the `users` with the `reviews` using a `JOIN`.  How many records are there?  What does that tell you about the two tables?

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM users
JOIN reviews ON users.user_id = reviews.user_id
LIMIT 0, 100;
```

```{block}
#| unilur-solution: true

Because there are fewer records in the join, we know that some reviews were done by users that are not in the `users` table. 
```



6. How many users wrote reviews in the `reviews` table but do not exist in the `users` table.  Hint: use a `RIGHT JOIN` to keep all the reviews, and then look for the rows where the `user_id` from the `users` table `IS NULL`.

```{sql}
#| connection: con_yelp
#| unilur-solution: true

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT reviews.user_id)
FROM users
RIGHT JOIN reviews ON users.user_id = reviews.user_id
WHERE users.user_id IS NULL;
```


```{block}
#| unilur-solution: true

There are 2,108 users who wrote 14,028 reviews and who are not in the users table.
```

7. Write a query to ask a question that you think is interesting and uses at least one join.  Provide both the question (in words) as well as the SQL code and results.



```{r}
#| echo: false
DBI::dbDisconnect(con_yelp, shutdown = TRUE)
```
