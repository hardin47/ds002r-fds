**Task:**
Today we are going to calculate the mean and the median.  I'll give you a series of numbers.  As I read the numbers, I want you to work at calculating both the mean and the median.


Reflection:  which is easier for you to calculate, the mean or the median?  which is easier for the computer to calculate?  Explain.

**Solution:**

1. If sorting the numbers and then finding the (average of the) middle numbers, the task will take $O(nlog(n))$ time.  That is, a dataset with 1000 records will be $(1000 \cdot log(1000)) / (100 \cdot log(100)) = 10 \cdot log(900)$ times slower than a data set with 100 records.  There are some caveats:  (1) some sorting algorithms are faster, and (2) you don't need to sort every number to get the median.  But generally, sorting is a slow operation!

2. Averaging is just summing, and it happens in linear time, $O(n)$.  That means that a dataset with 1000 records will be $1000/100 = 10$ times slower than a dataset with 100 records.

Generally, for a computer, it is easier to calculate a mean than a median, because of the need to sort in finding the median.
