update everything about your project.

IMPORTANT:  you want your website to represent **your** knowledge.  If all the code on there is from chatGPT or stack exchange, you might go back and re-write some of the code so that it actually represents what you have learned in the class.

To get an A:
  * do something new / expand extensively on one of the previous projects.
     - add extensive regular expressions to the project on string data
     - add a shiny or plotly example to the graphs from TidyTuesday
     
  * clean up the entire website
     - no warnings or messages
     - all plots with good labeling
     - alt text on all plots
     - good narrative describing 
     - making sure that all work, data sources, etc. are documented appropriately
     
  * corresponding document (text, Word, Google doc, etc.) describing (in enough detail to receive credit!) all of the changes you've made from the original set of projects.
  
  * don't call your analyses "my website" or "mini-project 2", use descriptive names that will make sense after the semester is over.
  
  * make sure that your citations are full.  That is, provide a lot more than the TidyTuesday URL. Who collected the data? Why? What is the original source of the information?
  
  * if you didn't put the recent projects onto your website, do so now.
  
  * provide a narrative setting up the analysis.  Don't just start with code.
  
  * use the tidyverse.  If you have gotten code from a different place (which uses `$` for example), translate the code into a tidy pipeline.




Project 5 has two main tasks:
The first is to re-do all the previous projects.  Things like removing the warnings & messages.  Making sure that all data and ideas have been properly cited.  Rewriting any code so that it is actually **your** work (instead of, for example, just copied directly from ChatGPT). Giving all graphs proper captions. Explaining your work.  You will write up (and turn in, separate from your website) a document explaining what changes and updates you’ve made.
The second thing to do is to prepare a ~5 min presentation on some aspect of your project.  It can be about any aspect of the project (or all aspects of the project), and your presentation should be as if to a client about the work.  You’ll create the presentation in Quarto (formatted as revealjs) rendered to html.  The presentation will be either on Friday morning during reading days or during our regularly scheduled final time, Monday Dec 9th 9am-noon (your choice).
Detailed instructions for Project 5 will be posted before the Thanksgiving break.  If you are already starting to work on updating past assignments, make sure to keep good notes on what updates and edits you are making.
