<!--

update everything about your project.

IMPORTANT:  you want your website to represent **your** knowledge.  If all the code on there is from chatGPT or stack exchange, you might go back and re-write some of the code so that it actually represents what you have learned in the class.

To get an A:
  * do something new / expand extensively on one of the previous projects.
     - add extensive regular expressions to the project on string data
     - add a shiny or plotly example to the graphs from TidyTuesday
     
  * clean up the entire website
     - no warnings or messages
     - all plots with good labeling
     - alt text on all plots
     - good narrative describing 
     - making sure that all work, data sources, etc. are documented appropriately
     
  * corresponding document (text, Word, Google doc, etc.) describing (in enough detail to receive credit!) all of the changes you've made from the original set of projects.
  
  * don't call your analyses "my website" or "mini-project 2", use descriptive names that will make sense after the semester is over.
  
  * make sure that your citations are full.  That is, provide a lot more than the TidyTuesday URL. Who collected the data? Why? What is the original source of the information?
  
  * if you didn't put the recent projects onto your website, do so now.
  
  * provide a narrative setting up the analysis.  Don't just start with code.
  
  * use the tidyverse.  If you have gotten code from a different place (which uses `$` for example), translate the code into a tidy pipeline.
